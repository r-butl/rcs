Overview
1. Human-Level AI will transform the world.
2. LLMs can never get us to Human-Level AI.
3. Cognitive AI will get us to Human-Level AI. We have the most advanced Cognitive AI that leads us to AGI/ Human-Level AI.

#Cognition is the missing link. #CognitiveAI is the path.

We have a proven #CognitiveAI model that has already replaced 1000s of human agents at Call Centers showcasing its potential to replicate human thought and reasoning while generating 7-figure in ARR.

Now we are getting ready to extend and evolve this Cognitive Brain to Human-Level AI.

Cognitive AI doesn't require massive amounts of data or compute.

Cognitive AI approach does not suffer 'hallucinations' and offers a clear path to full AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). DARPA calls this 'The Third wave of AI'.

It is fully scrutable, explainable, accurate, predictable and reliable with no requirement for human in the loop.

Aigo.ai company now has a detailed plan to extend this Core Cognitive AI technology to full human-level cognitive ability.

Peter Voss, a trailblazing figure in AI who coined the term ‘Artificial General Intelligence’ (#AGI) in 2002 with others, is the CEO and Chief Scientist at Aigo.ai and he is on a mission for 20 years to bring Human-Level AI to the world to optimize human flourishing.

Human-Level AI (AGI) will culminate in significantly lowering costs for many products and services; providing PhD-level AI researchers to help us solve problems like disease, energy, and pollution; and help companies and individuals with expert personal assistants.

This isn’t just a mission; it’s a movement to change the world for the better.

About the job
AGI/Cognitive Science Software Engineer

https://aigo.ai/careers/


Are you eager to be a key member of the global team driving the creation of full human-level AGI?
 
Aigo.ai has long been at the forefront of developing and commercializing Cognitive AI technology designed to lead to true AGI. We’ve recently launched an exciting new phase to accelerate the development of our core AGI technology, with the goal of rapidly achieving full human-level intelligence.
 
We’re gathering interest from brilliant, highly skilled software engineers who thrive on tackling complex software challenges and are deeply motivated to help make AGI a reality. If you’re fascinated by the nature of intelligence, comfortable thinking like a cognitive scientist, and eager to contribute to cutting-edge AGI research, we want to hear from you.
 
Engineers work closely with Aigo’s chief scientist to develop cognitive AGI. Prior AI experience is not required—our approach is fundamentally different from logic-based, rule-based, or statistical systems—but a minimum of 2 years of software engineering experience is necessary. This role doesn’t involve full-stack, communications, cloud, or security work; it’s all about heavy-duty algorithmic design, development, and debugging. Strong analytical thinking and logical problem-solving skills are essential. Our platform is built with .NET Core/C#.
 
We offer a competitive salary, core-team stock options, comprehensive benefits, and the opportunity to work on the most exciting technology alongside an amazing team. While we’re headquartered in Austin, TX, we welcome remote candidates from almost any location. Whether you’re in Europe, Asia, Africa, the Americas, or beyond, we invite you to be part of our journey to transform the future of intelligence.
 
This is not your typical 9-to-5 job—we’re on a mission to change the world.
